PROJECT GOAL: Develop an informatics framework for understanding and optimizing regional food systems (“foodsheds”). 
DESCRIPTION: This project developed a transdisciplinary research coordination network (RCN), bringing together researchers and community stakeholders to build a general informatics framework for understanding and optimizing the food system. The project enabled two foodsheds—the 6-county Sacramento, California region and the 7-county Columbus, Ohio region—to link multiple data types from multiple sources and convert it into usable information through data analytics approaches.",,"Infrastructure, Training, Publication, Template","""University of California, Davis"", Ohio State University",,,https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show-award?AWD_ID=1737573,National Science Foundation,2018-2021,,,
