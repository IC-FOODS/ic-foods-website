# Product Naming and Attributes

Standardized naming conventions ensure consistent identification of produce items across systems and supply chains. This guideline defines the required attributes and naming formats for produce products.

## Core Attributes

All produce items must include the following core attributes:

- **Product Name**: Use standardized common names (e.g., "Red Delicious Apple", not "Apples")
- **Variety**: Specific cultivar or variety designation when applicable
- **Size Class**: Standard size categories (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large)
- **Grade**: Quality grade designation (USDA grades or equivalent)
- **Origin**: Country and region of production

## Naming Conventions

Product names should follow this structure:

```
[Variety] [Product Type] [Size Class] [Grade]
```

Example: "Red Delicious Apple Large Grade A"

## Attribute Definitions

### Size Classifications

Size classes are defined by weight or count ranges specific to each product type. Reference the official size classification tables for detailed specifications.

### Grade Standards

Grades must reference recognized standards such as USDA grades, EU standards, or equivalent certification bodies.

## Implementation Notes

- Use consistent terminology across all systems
- Maintain a master product catalog
- Update naming conventions as new varieties are introduced
