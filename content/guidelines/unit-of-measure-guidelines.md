# Unit of Measure Guidelines

Standardized units of measure ensure accurate quantity representation and enable proper conversions across different measurement systems. This guideline defines required units and conversion factors.

## Primary Units

### Weight-Based Units

- **Kilograms (kg)**: Primary metric unit for weight
- **Pounds (lb)**: Imperial unit (provide kg equivalent)
- **Grams (g)**: For small quantities

### Count-Based Units

- **Each (ea)**: Individual items
- **Count per package**: Number of items in a package
- **Bunches**: For items sold in bunches

### Volume-Based Units

- **Liters (L)**: For liquid products
- **Cubic meters (m³)**: For bulk volumes

## Conversion Factors

Standard conversion factors must be used:

- 1 kg = 2.20462 lb
- 1 lb = 0.453592 kg
- 1 L = 0.264172 gallons (US)

## Package Specifications

When specifying package quantities:

- Include both net weight and count
- Specify package type (box, crate, bag)
- Provide package dimensions when relevant

## Implementation

- Always specify the unit of measure explicitly
- Provide conversions for international trade
- Use decimal precision appropriate to the measurement type
- Round according to standard rounding rules
